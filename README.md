# iOS Weather App using Swift and SwiftUI

Welcome to my iOS Weather App project! üå¶Ô∏èüì±

This is a beginner-level project that I'm working on as part of my journey into iOS app development using Swift and SwiftUI. The goal of this project is to create a simple yet functional weather app that provides users with current weather conditions based on their location.

## Features:
- Display weather information using a clean and user-friendly interface.
- (in the future)Utilize Core Location to fetch the user's location and provide relevant weather data.
- Implement Swift's powerful SwiftUI framework for designing a responsive and dynamic UI.

Gradually expand the app's capabilities as I learn more about iOS development.

## Technologies Used:
- Swift programming language
- SwiftUI framework
- (in the future) Core Location framework

## Future Plans:
As I continue my learning journey in iOS development, I plan to enhance the app with additional features such as:

- [ ] Multi-day weather forecasts
- [ ] User preferences for metric/imperial units
- [ ]Integration with a weather API for accurate data
- [ ]Improved UI/UX design

I'm excited to share my progress and growth in iOS development through this project. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even collaborate with me if you're interested!

Stay tuned for updates as I make improvements and add more functionality to the app. Thank you for checking out my iOS Weather App project!
